        "This `integrate` function is adding together areas of rectangles. And you can see in the region between 0 and 10, the rectangles miss a little bit (that white triangle at the top). So we expect this number to **underestimate** the correct answer. On paper, analytically calculate the correct answer for this function between 0 and 10. How does it compare to this answer?"
